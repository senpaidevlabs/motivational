{"quote":"The things you learn in maturity arenâ€™t simple things such as acquiring information and skills. You learn not to engage in self-destructive behavior. You learn not to burn up energy in anxiety. You discover how to manage your tensions. You learn that self-pity and resentment are among the most toxic of drugs. You find that the world loves talent but pays off on character.","length":"381","author":"John Gardner","tags":["character","inspire","maturity","tso-life","tso-management"],"category":"inspire","date":"2017-11-04","permalink":"https://theysaidso.com/quote/hWeaTjHTSnWGUMWwmtyfTweF/john-gardner-the-things-you-learn-in-maturity-arent-simple-things-such-as-acquir","title":"Inspiring Quote of the day","background":"https://theysaidso.com/img/bgs/man_on_the_mountain.jpg","id":"hWeaTjHTSnWGUMWwmtyfTweF","shortened_url":"http://bit.ly/2h4pH1v"}
